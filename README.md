This is a simple clone of the popular Flappy Bird game, developed using Java and Swing.  
The player controls a bird by tapping or pressing a key to keep it in the air, while  
trying to fly through gaps between moving pipes. The game includes basic collision  
detection, scoring, and game-over logic.
